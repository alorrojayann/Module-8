# Module-8: Aggregating Pandas DataFrames

ðŸ’¡This module introduced us to a variety of data aggregation methods using pandas and different data sets (weather and stocks). 

We still utilized functions that we already know but a lot of new ones are introduced. 
Some comcepts are still tricky for me to grasp but I intend to study them in order to fully understand their function.
